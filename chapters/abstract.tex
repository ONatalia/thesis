\chapter*{Abstract}
In recent years, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have improved
increasingly. However, often such systems work non-incrementally, producing 
the end result after the utterance is already finished. For applications, where intermediate system reactions of ASRs are desirable,  
incremental output of the intermediate results becomes increasingly important. Benefits of  incremental speech recognition 
include post-processing time savings, faster system feedback and more natural dialogue between humans and intelligent systems. 
Commercial Google recognition engine, able to run in incremental mode, produces accurate results in non-specific domains,
 but demonstrates higher latency. In addition Google results provide no  timing information for the words, occurring in  the recognized sentences. 
 Forced alignment, absent in Google, is of great importance for dialogue systems, involving non-verbal recognition.  
Non-commercial open source Sphinx-4 system, on the other hand, demonstrates very short delays and can be timed to specific applications, but is 
less reliable in accuracy. This master thesis investigates the possibilities of Google+Sphinx combination within the frames of Incremental Spoken Dialogue 
Processing Toolkit (InproTK). The central part of the the proposed architecture is a Incremental Unit (IU) module, which guarantees that Google incremental 
results are passed to Sphinx recognizer, working in a forced-alignment mode. Google+Sphinx alignment results as well as the results of Google and Sphinx 
alone are to be evaluated against the gold standard. Furthermore, we propose approaches,allowing combination of alignment and recognition within  Google+Sphinx 
architecture. The main focus of the analyses is the Sphinx-4 SearchGraph path alternations strategies. 
Finally, we discuss the problems of timeliness results evaluation.

% The challenge is to combine the advantages of both systems and  to overcome the latency problem of Google-ASR.

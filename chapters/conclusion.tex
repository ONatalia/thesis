\section {Conclusion}
This master thesis has presented a prototypical solution for incremental speech
recognizer combination of Google and Sphinx. 
%The described implementation has shown a better timing in comparison to Google.

Incremental speech recognizer is possible to run in 2 modes: alignment only and
alignment + recognition. Incremental results, coming from Google, have been
aligned using forced alignment IU module and Sphinx ASR. Evaluation of
alignment  results quality have shown that Google + Sphinx combination produces
missing in Google alone timing information. The quality of Google+Sphinx
alignment is comparable to the alignment of the Sphinx alone. Under the
assumption that processing time of Sphinx, which depends on computational power,
could have been neglected, Google+Sphinx in the alignment mode is competitive
with Google in its performance. 

To overcome the Google latency two 2 approaches have been tested.  The first one
uses a combination of alignment and JSGF grammar. The second one combines the
alignment and n-gram grammars.  In both cases the search graph consists of two
connected parts. The first part  represent results, coming from Google.
The second contains the nodes, reconstructed from the
corresponding grammar types. Moreover the tests have proved that, using a n-gram
grammar it is possible to reduce the search space in the second part of the
graph by modifying the search path, depending on Google hypotheses. 

Finally, timeliness of Google, Sphinx and Google+Sphinx results have been
analysed. Evaluation has shown that Google+Sphinx in alignment+recognition mode
has shown an improvement in comparison to Google alone and Google+Sphinx in
alignment mode. Timeliness quality growth in alignment+recognition mode is
explained by the possibility of Google+Sphinx to deliver intermediate
recognition results while waiting for Google hypotheses.

Timo, probably you could give me some hints.
